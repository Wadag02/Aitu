# Laboratory 1: Functions and Recursion

This project contains recursive implementations of various mathematical functions.

## Features:
- Finding the minimum element in an array.
- Calculating the average of an array.
- Checking for prime numbers.
- Computing factorial, Fibonacci numbers, and power.
- Printing arrays in reverse.
